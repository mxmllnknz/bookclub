# bookclub
bookclub is a public Discord bot developed to mimic the functionality of reading tracker applications like GoodReads inside a server.

# How to use it
Once bookclub is installed on your Discord server, you can make commands in any text channel by beginning your message with a dollar sign ($).

To see what commands are available to be used, simply type $help.

Currently functional:
   - $ping : Checks to see whether bookclub is running nominally
   - $pages : Returns the total number of pages you've read
   - $reading : Returns a list of books you're currently reading
   - $set : Set or update a book's reading status in your library ("want to read"/"reading"/"read")
   - $search : Returns the top search result given a title (for multi-word titles, use quotations around the title)
